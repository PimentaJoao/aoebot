# AoEBot

## About

[BETA] This is a Age of Empires bot for discord, which enables people that are connected to a voice chat to use AoE2 chat taunt sounds.

## Technology

It uses Node.js and Discord's own framework, Discord.js.

## Roadmap

### 2017
- ~~Basic commands (connect, disconnect, etc.)~~
- ~~Working taunts~~

## 2021
- ~~Update packages and code accordingly (a lot has changed since first implementation)~~
- ~~Multiple servers support~~
- ~~Host on Heroku~~
- Persistent per-server configs (mongoDB)
- Aditional quality of life bot stuff (customizable prefix, text-only taunt maybe)
- A beautiful website for distribution
- Stress test, benchmark, responsible grown up stuff
- Monetize this bot somehow...?

## To-do

- Improve message filter
- Current multiple server support is bad, replace with a better long term solution
- Study and determine if creating an API to handle multiple bot informations and configs is feasible
